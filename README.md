👋 Hi, I'm Peng Dongxu (@pengdongxu) - a **Java Architect specializing in mission-critical Internet Hospital platforms**. Based in Wuhan, China, I'm at the forefront of merging robust backend engineering with the transformative power of AI in healthcare.

🏥 My core expertise lies in architecting and delivering **high-availability, scalable backend systems** that underpin complex medical workflows. I thrive on taking projects from initial concept to successful deployment, always prioritizing pragmatic technical solutions that directly address business needs within the healthcare domain.

🧠 **Deeply intrigued by the potential of AI Large Models**, I'm actively exploring and implementing solutions leveraging technologies like DeepSeek and OpenAI for intelligent medical Q&A, streamlined knowledge management, and enhanced clinical decision support. This involves not just integration, but crafting innovative applications that truly augment healthcare professionals' capabilities.

🛠️ **My Technical Arsenal:**

* **Backend Powerhouse:** `Java` | `Spring Boot` | `Spring Cloud` | `MyBatis` | `MySQL` | `Redis` | `Kafka` | `RabbitMQ` - Proven ability to build resilient and performant microservices.
* **Frontend Agility:** `Vue3` | `TypeScript` | `Element Plus` | `Electron` | `Vite` - Experienced in crafting intuitive user interfaces that integrate seamlessly with backend systems.
* **DevOps Efficiency:** `Docker` | `Nginx` | `GitLab CI` | `Harbor` | `Prometheus` | `Grafana` - Committed to establishing robust CI/CD pipelines and monitoring solutions for reliable deployments.
* **AI Integration Specialist:** Hands-on experience integrating and customizing Large Model APIs (OpenAI, DeepSeek) to solve real-world healthcare challenges.
* **Data & Search:** `ElasticSearch`, with a focus on leveraging its capabilities for intelligent search and data analysis within medical contexts.
* **Cloud Proficiency:** Experienced with both `Tencent Cloud` and `Alibaba Cloud` infrastructure and services.

🔭 **Currently Pioneering:**

* **Intelligent Knowledge Hub:** Architecting an internal knowledge platform powered by Large Language Models to provide instant, context-aware answers for development documentation and critical business insights.
* **Empowering Engineering Excellence:** Mentoring core development team members, establishing and enforcing technical standards, and fostering a collaborative environment focused on high-quality deliverables.
